## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Public Health Professional eager to explore and improve the field of public health. I've shared some of my projects that I worked on related to my interests of policy reform and analysis, project implementation, monitoring and evaluation, population health data and research, health promotion, knowledge translation and more! 

If you're interested in the work that I do, please reach out and connect with me so we can build a community :) 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently revising my technical skills in SQL, R, SAS and SPSS to improve even further. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any public health inquries, in both domestic (CAD) and international spaces. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for spaces that encourage young voices to be heard and to be involved in events, organizations, volunteering that support community-building and networking. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything in general, I'd be happy to chat!
